2025-03-04 10:59:05,155-DEBUG-[system] You are an expert quant researcher developing formulaic alphas.

# Specification

The formulaic alphas are expressed as mathematical expressions.
An expression can be a real constant between -30 and 30, an input feature, or an operator applied with its operands.
The input features available are: $open, $close, $high, $low, $volume, $vwap.
The operators, their descriptions, and their required operand types are listed in the table below. The operands x and y denote expressions, and t denotes a time span in days between "1d" and "50d".

Abs(x): absolute value
Log(x): logarithm
Add(x,y): add
Sub(x,y): subtract
Mul(x,y): multiply
Div(x,y): divide
Greater(x,y): larger one of two expressions
Less(x,y): smaller one of two expressions
Ref(x,t): the input expression at t days before
Mean(x,t): mean in the past t days
Sum(x,t): total sum in the past t days
Std(x,t): standard deviation in the past t days
Var(x,t): variance in the past t days
Max(x,t): maximum in the past t days
Min(x,t): minimum in the past t days
Med(x,t): median in the past t days
Mad(x,t): mean Absolute Deviation in the past t days
Delta(x,t): difference of the expression between today and t days before
WMA(x,t): weighted moving average in the past t days
EMA(x,t): exponential moving average in the past t days
Cov(x,y,t): covariance between two time-series in the past t days
Corr(x,y,t): correlation of two time-series in the past t days

Some examples of formulaic alphas:
- Abs(Sub(EMA(open,30d),30.))
- Max(WMA(open,10d),20d)
- Cov(Ref(volume,10d),open,50d)
- Greater(0.1,volume)

## Limits

- You may not need to access any real-world stock data, since I will provide you with enough information to make a decision.
- You should give me alphas that are of medium length, not too long, nor too short.
- Do not use features or operators that are not listed above.

2025-03-04 10:59:05,608-DEBUG-[user] Please generate 20 alphas that you think would be indicative of future stock price trend. Each alpha should be on its own line without numbering. Please do not output anything else.

2025-03-04 11:06:39,251-DEBUG-[user] Here are a set of formulaic alphas generated by an automated system. These alphas are combined with a linear model into the final predictive signal. The alphas and the combined signal are tested on real-world dataset, and the IC/Rank IC metrics of them, together with the alphas' weights in the linear model is reported as follows:
Mean(open,50d): IC = 0.0135, weight = 0.0148  This is a good alpha!
Var(open,30d): IC = 0.0006, weight = -0.0061  This is a good alpha!
Std(open,30d): IC = 0.0039, weight = -0.0028  This is a good alpha!
Ref(high,50d): IC = 0.0128, weight = 0.0023  This is a good alpha!
WMA(volume,50d): IC = -0.0076, weight = -0.0004  This is a good alpha!
WMA(volume,50d): IC = -0.0076, weight = -0.0004  This is a good alpha!
Ref(volume,10d): IC = -0.0071, weight = -0.0002  This is a good alpha!
Ref(volume,10d): IC = -0.0071, weight = -0.0002  This is a good alpha!
WMA(open,1d): IC = 0.0000, weight = -0.0001  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
Ref(open,1d): IC = 0.0106, weight = 0.0001  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
Ref(open,1d): IC = 0.0106, weight = 0.0001  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
Ref(open,1d): IC = 0.0106, weight = 0.0001  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
Std(open,10d): IC = 0.0072, weight = -0.0001  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
Ref(close,1d): IC = 0.0103, weight = 0.0001  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
Cov(open,close,10d): IC = 0.0050, weight = 0.0001  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
WMA(open,10d): IC = 0.0106, weight = 0.0000  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
Mean(open,20d): IC = 0.0113, weight = 0.0000  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
Std(open,50d): IC = 0.0096, weight = -0.0000  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
Ref(high,1d): IC = 0.0104, weight = -0.0000  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
Ref(high,1d): IC = 0.0104, weight = -0.0000  This alpha doesn't contribute much.
Ensemble: IC = 0.0180, Rank IC = 0.0426
According to the result, please generate 12 more alphas, not similar to the insignificant ones. The most insignificant alphas will be replaced with the new ones to potentially boost the performance. Again, one on each line without numbering, and do not output anything else.
