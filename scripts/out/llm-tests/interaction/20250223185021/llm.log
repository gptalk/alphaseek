2025-02-23 18:50:32,103-DEBUG-[system] You are an expert quant researcher developing formulaic alphas.

# Specification

The formulaic alphas are expressed as mathematical expressions.
An expression can be a real constant between -30 and 30, an input feature, or an operator applied with its operands.
The input features available are: $open, $close, $high, $low, $volume, $vwap.
The operators, their descriptions, and their required operand types are listed in the table below. The operands x and y denote expressions, and t denotes a time span in days between "1d" and "50d".

Abs(x): absolute value
Log(x): logarithm
Add(x,y): add
Sub(x,y): subtract
Mul(x,y): multiply
Div(x,y): divide
Greater(x,y): larger one of two expressions
Less(x,y): smaller one of two expressions
Ref(x,t): the input expression at t days before
Mean(x,t): mean in the past t days
Sum(x,t): total sum in the past t days
Std(x,t): standard deviation in the past t days
Var(x,t): variance in the past t days
Max(x,t): maximum in the past t days
Min(x,t): minimum in the past t days
Med(x,t): median in the past t days
Mad(x,t): mean Absolute Deviation in the past t days
Delta(x,t): difference of the expression between today and t days before
WMA(x,t): weighted moving average in the past t days
EMA(x,t): exponential moving average in the past t days
Cov(x,y,t): covariance between two time-series in the past t days
Corr(x,y,t): correlation of two time-series in the past t days

Some examples of formulaic alphas:
- Abs(Sub(EMA(open,30d),30.))
- Max(WMA(open,10d),20d)
- Cov(Ref(volume,10d),open,50d)
- Greater(0.1,volume)

## Limits

- You may not need to access any real-world stock data, since I will provide you with enough information to make a decision.
- You should give me alphas that are of medium length, not too long, nor too short.
- Do not use features or operators that are not listed above.

2025-02-23 18:50:33,838-DEBUG-[user] Please generate 20 alphas that you think would be indicative of future stock price trend. Each alpha should be on its own line without numbering. Please do not output anything else.

These alphas are mathematical expressions using specific operators and input features like open, close, high, low, volume, vwap. The goal is to create indicators that might predict future stock price trends.', '', 'First, I should recall the list of allowed operators: Abs, Log, Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Greater, Less, Ref, Mean, Sum, Std, Var, Max, Min, Med, Mad, Delta, WMA, EMA. Each operator has specific uses and requirements, so I need to make sure each alpha complies.', '', 'The examples given include combinations like using EMA(open,30d) or Cov(volume, open). So, I should think about common indicators that might relate to price trends.', '', "I'll start by considering trend momentum indicators. Moving Averages (MA) are fundamental. Maybe a simple MA strategy: Close today minus 20-day MA of close. That could indicate if the price is above or below its average.", '', 'Next, RSI is a popular oscillator. It measures overbought/oversold conditions. Using Ref to look back 14 days for high and low could help calculate RSI, which might predict reversals.', '', 'Bollinger Bands are another key indicator, using MA with standard deviations. The width of the bands can indicate volatility and trend strength. So, Bollinger Bandwidth could be a good alpha.', '', 'MACD is a momentum oscillator using moving averages. Calculating the difference between 25ma and 10ma on close might show momentum shifts.', '', 'VIX is often represented by IV, measuring expected volatility. Using WMA to look at open over 30 days could give an indication of market fear or calm.', '', "Average Directional Index (ADX) measures trend strength regardless of direction. Calculating the difference between today's ADX and its 25-day MA might show if the trend is strengthening or weakening.", '', "Elder's Fisher Transform is used to detect potential reversals based on volume. It could help identify changes in market sentiment.", '', 'Momentum indicators like the 10-period RSI, as I mentioned earlier, are straightforward yet effective for trend detection.', '', 'Candlestick body size (like WMA of close over 20 days) can indicate strength or weakness in a trend.', '', 'The Chande Momentum Oscillator uses high and low to measure momentum. A 3-period EMA could make it more responsive.', '', 'On-Balance Volume tracks volume changes with price movements, which might signal continuation or divergence.', '', 'The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is another oscillator; using Fast RSI on high might highlight overbought/sold conditions.', '', 'Covariance between volume and open can indicate if volume moves with price action. A 50-day Covariance might capture significant movement.', '', 'Correlation between volume and close shows how aligned they are, which could hint at market sentiment.', '', 'Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) measures volatility similar to RSI but using median, making it robust against outliers.', '', 'Theta decay in EMA can show how quickly the trend is decaying. A 20-period EMA of theta might indicate trend strength.', '', 'Variance over a period shows how spread out the data is, which could reflect market uncertainty or stability.', '', 'Lastly, combining multiple indicators like RSI and ADX with different time frames (e.g., RSI(14) on close vs. ADX 25) can create complex yet informative alphas.', '', "I should make sure each alpha uses valid operators and features without exceeding the allowed t values.
