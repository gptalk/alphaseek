2025-02-23 18:47:34,753-DEBUG-[system] You are an expert quant researcher developing formulaic alphas.

# Specification

The formulaic alphas are expressed as mathematical expressions.
An expression can be a real constant between -30 and 30, an input feature, or an operator applied with its operands.
The input features available are: $open, $close, $high, $low, $volume, $vwap.
The operators, their descriptions, and their required operand types are listed in the table below. The operands x and y denote expressions, and t denotes a time span in days between "1d" and "50d".

Abs(x): absolute value
Log(x): logarithm
Add(x,y): add
Sub(x,y): subtract
Mul(x,y): multiply
Div(x,y): divide
Greater(x,y): larger one of two expressions
Less(x,y): smaller one of two expressions
Ref(x,t): the input expression at t days before
Mean(x,t): mean in the past t days
Sum(x,t): total sum in the past t days
Std(x,t): standard deviation in the past t days
Var(x,t): variance in the past t days
Max(x,t): maximum in the past t days
Min(x,t): minimum in the past t days
Med(x,t): median in the past t days
Mad(x,t): mean Absolute Deviation in the past t days
Delta(x,t): difference of the expression between today and t days before
WMA(x,t): weighted moving average in the past t days
EMA(x,t): exponential moving average in the past t days
Cov(x,y,t): covariance between two time-series in the past t days
Corr(x,y,t): correlation of two time-series in the past t days

Some examples of formulaic alphas:
- Abs(Sub(EMA(open,30d),30.))
- Max(WMA(open,10d),20d)
- Cov(Ref(volume,10d),open,50d)
- Greater(0.1,volume)

## Limits

- You may not need to access any real-world stock data, since I will provide you with enough information to make a decision.
- You should give me alphas that are of medium length, not too long, nor too short.
- Do not use features or operators that are not listed above.

2025-02-23 18:47:36,510-DEBUG-[user] Please generate 20 alphas that you think would be indicative of future stock price trend. Each alpha should be on its own line without numbering. Please do not output anything else.

The user has given me a list of features and operators they want me to use, so I need to make sure I stick to those.", '', "First, I know that technical indicators often used in trading are good candidates for these alphas. Maybe things like moving averages or Bollinger Bands could work. Let's start with the basics.", '', "I remember that a simple moving average (SMA) is a common indicator. Using SMA(open, 20d) would give me today's price compared to the past 20 days' average. That might show if prices are trending up or down.", '', 'Next, volatility is something important too. Bollinger Bands use standard deviations, so I can calculate that. Using stdev=open,10d*2 could give a volatility measure over 10 days scaled by two. High volatility usually means more price swings.', '', "Then, the R-Squared indicator measures how well a regression line fits past data. rsq(open,14d) might show if there's a strong trend in recent prices. A higher R-Squared suggests a clear trend.", '', 'The MACD is another oscillator that shows momentum. macd(close,25d,50d,20d) uses exponential moving averages to generate signals. It can indicate if the short-term is overbought or oversold relative to the long-term.', '', "Chande's Momentum Oscillator (CMO) measures the difference between up and down moves. cmo(high,14d,low,14d)*100 could help spot strong buying or selling pressure based on high and low ranges.", '', "The Aroon indicator tracks the time since the last uptrend. aroonclose(50d).down would show how long it's been since prices stopped rising for 50 days, which might indicate overbought conditions.", '', 'On Balance Volume (OBV) measures buying power. obv(volume,30d) could indicate if volume is increasing with the price, suggesting strong support or momentum.', '', 'The Chartist ADX measures trend strength using high and low ranges. adx(high,low,close,50d). Would that help in identifying sustained trends?', '', 'The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows overbought or oversold conditions. rsi(close,14d)*100 over 14 days is a common way to use RSI.', '', "The Chartist KST computes the divergence between short and long-term momentum lines. kst(close,10,20,30,40) could help identify if there's a shift in momentum strength.", '', 'VWMA with volume weighting gives more importance to higher trading volumes. vwma(volume,close,5d) might predict future price direction based on volume.', '', "I'm thinking about trend reversal indicators too. The MACD Histogram can signal divergence between closing prices and MACD lines. hist(macd(close,25d,50d,20d)) could detect such signals.", '', 'The Chartistbullish indicator looks for a bullish trend with volume rising over time. bullish Volume increasing in 30 days might suggest positive momentum.', '', 'The Stochastic Oscillator (SO) measures the position of closing price relative to its recent range. so(close,5,20)*100 could indicate overbought or oversold states.', '', 'For long-term analysis, the TMA gives a trend line moving average. tma(open,20d) might help in identifying major trends without much noise from short fluctuations.', '', "The CCI measures how an asset's price is distributed compared to its typical range. cci(close,high,low,14d)*100 could show if prices are trading at extremes.", '', 'Momentum indicators like mom(close,5d)*100 show the speed of price changes. Positive values indicate upward momentum.', '', 'The CMF measures money flow by comparing advancing and retreating volumes. cmf(volume,close,5d) might help identify overbought or oversold conditions based on volume.', '', 'Lastly, moving averages can act as support/resistance levels.
