2025-02-23 14:40:15,228-DEBUG-[system] You are an expert quant researcher developing formulaic alphas.

# Specification

The formulaic alphas are expressed as mathematical expressions.
An expression can be a real constant between -30 and 30, an input feature, or an operator applied with its operands.
The input features available are: $open, $close, $high, $low, $volume, $vwap.
The operators, their descriptions, and their required operand types are listed in the table below. The operands x and y denote expressions, and t denotes a time span in days between "1d" and "50d".

Abs(x): absolute value
Log(x): logarithm
Add(x,y): add
Sub(x,y): subtract
Mul(x,y): multiply
Div(x,y): divide
Greater(x,y): larger one of two expressions
Less(x,y): smaller one of two expressions
Ref(x,t): the input expression at t days before
Mean(x,t): mean in the past t days
Sum(x,t): total sum in the past t days
Std(x,t): standard deviation in the past t days
Var(x,t): variance in the past t days
Max(x,t): maximum in the past t days
Min(x,t): minimum in the past t days
Med(x,t): median in the past t days
Mad(x,t): mean Absolute Deviation in the past t days
Delta(x,t): difference of the expression between today and t days before
WMA(x,t): weighted moving average in the past t days
EMA(x,t): exponential moving average in the past t days
Cov(x,y,t): covariance between two time-series in the past t days
Corr(x,y,t): correlation of two time-series in the past t days

Some examples of formulaic alphas:
- Abs(Sub(EMA(open,30d),30.))
- Max(WMA(open,10d),20d)
- Cov(Ref(volume,10d),open,50d)
- Greater(0.1,volume)

## Limits

- You may not need to access any real-world stock data, since I will provide you with enough information to make a decision.
- You should give me alphas that are of medium length, not too long, nor too short.
- Do not use features or operators that are not listed above.

2025-02-23 14:40:15,778-DEBUG-[user] Please generate 20 alphas that you think would be indicative of future stock price trend. Each alpha should be on its own line without numbering. Please do not output anything else.

Let me try to break down what needs to be done here.", '', "First off, the user is an expert quant researcher looking for alpha factors. These are mathematical expressions using specific operators and input features like open, close, high, low, volume, vwap. The goal is to generate 20 alphas that indicate future stock trends without using any real-world data beyond what's provided.", '', 'Looking at the specifications, each alpha should be a formulaic expression as per the given table. They can use constants between -30 and 30, input features, or operators with their operands defined as x and y.

Also, they should be of medium length—not too long or too short. So I have to balance complexity with simplicity.", '', 'Starting with basic indicators: moving averages are common in technical analysis. EMA and WMA could be good starting points since they smooth out price data. For example, EMA(open,10d) gives the exponential moving average of open prices over 10 days.', '', "Then there's delta, which compares today's value to past values. Delta(open,1d) tells how much the opening price has changed in one day.", '', 'For volatility, standard deviation and variance are options. Std(open,5d) measures variability over five days.', '', 'Correlation can show how two features move together. Corr(volume,close,20d) would indicate if volume moves with closing prices over 20 days.', '', 'Combining these, I can create alphas that use multiple operations. For instance, using Max and Min to set thresholds or combining EMA with delta for trend strength.', '', 'I should also consider combinations like Cov between volume and open to see their joint behavior. Similarly, using Ref to look back in time, like Ref(volume,10d), and then applying operations on it.', '', "It's important not to repeat the same operators too much; mixing Add, Sub, Div will make each alpha unique. Also, ensuring that each uses different features or time spans can add diversity.", '', "I'll need to list 20 distinct alphas without duplication in structure or use of features.
