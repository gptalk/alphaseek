2025-02-23 15:27:02,126-DEBUG-[system] You are an expert quant researcher developing formulaic alphas.

# Specification

The formulaic alphas are expressed as mathematical expressions.
An expression can be a real constant between -30 and 30, an input feature, or an operator applied with its operands.
The input features available are: $open, $close, $high, $low, $volume, $vwap.
The operators, their descriptions, and their required operand types are listed in the table below. The operands x and y denote expressions, and t denotes a time span in days between "1d" and "50d".

Abs(x): absolute value
Log(x): logarithm
Add(x,y): add
Sub(x,y): subtract
Mul(x,y): multiply
Div(x,y): divide
Greater(x,y): larger one of two expressions
Less(x,y): smaller one of two expressions
Ref(x,t): the input expression at t days before
Mean(x,t): mean in the past t days
Sum(x,t): total sum in the past t days
Std(x,t): standard deviation in the past t days
Var(x,t): variance in the past t days
Max(x,t): maximum in the past t days
Min(x,t): minimum in the past t days
Med(x,t): median in the past t days
Mad(x,t): mean Absolute Deviation in the past t days
Delta(x,t): difference of the expression between today and t days before
WMA(x,t): weighted moving average in the past t days
EMA(x,t): exponential moving average in the past t days
Cov(x,y,t): covariance between two time-series in the past t days
Corr(x,y,t): correlation of two time-series in the past t days

Some examples of formulaic alphas:
- Abs(Sub(EMA(open,30d),30.))
- Max(WMA(open,10d),20d)
- Cov(Ref(volume,10d),open,50d)
- Greater(0.1,volume)

## Limits

- You may not need to access any real-world stock data, since I will provide you with enough information to make a decision.
- You should give me alphas that are of medium length, not too long, nor too short.
- Do not use features or operators that are not listed above.

2025-02-23 15:27:34,902-DEBUG-[user] Please generate 20 alphas that you think would be indicative of future stock price trend. Each alpha should be on its own line without numbering. Please do not output anything else.
2025-02-23 15:27:55,541-DEBUG-[assistant] ['<think>', 'Okay, so the user is an expert quant researcher looking to develop formulaic alphas for predicting stock price trends. They provided a detailed specification about how these alphas are structured and what operators they can use. My task is to generate 20 such alphas based on their guidelines.', '', "First, I need to understand what each operator does and how the available features like open, close, high, low, volume, and vwap can be used. The user mentioned that these alphas should be of medium length, so they shouldn't be too long or too short. That means I need to balance between simple expressions and those that incorporate a few steps.", '', "I'll start by considering common indicators like moving averages (EMA, WMA), volatility measures (like Std, Var), trend indicators (like Med, Min, Max), and momentum oscillators (Delta). These are all standard in alpha generation and should fit the criteria of being medium length.", '', "For example, EMA(open,5d) uses the exponential moving average on the open price over 5 days. That's straightforward but useful for identifying trend strength. Similarly, Std(high,20d) measures volatility based on high prices over 20 days.", '', 'I should also think about combining features to create more complex indicators. For instance, Med(close,10d) uses a median approach which can be less volatile than EMA and might capture price movement better in certain conditions. Using volume with WMA, like WMA(volume,30d), could indicate strength based on recent trading activity.', '', "Another consideration is using lookback periods that aren't too far or too recent to get meaningful insights. For example, 1d is the most immediate past day, which can show if today's price is breaking a pattern from yesterday. ", '', 'I also need to ensure each alpha uses only allowed operators and features without mixing real-world data beyond whatâ€™s provided.
