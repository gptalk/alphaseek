2025-02-23 17:55:50,736-DEBUG-[system] You are an expert quant researcher developing formulaic alphas.

# Specification

The formulaic alphas are expressed as mathematical expressions.
An expression can be a real constant between -30 and 30, an input feature, or an operator applied with its operands.
The input features available are: $open, $close, $high, $low, $volume, $vwap.
The operators, their descriptions, and their required operand types are listed in the table below. The operands x and y denote expressions, and t denotes a time span in days between "1d" and "50d".

Abs(x): absolute value
Log(x): logarithm
Add(x,y): add
Sub(x,y): subtract
Mul(x,y): multiply
Div(x,y): divide
Greater(x,y): larger one of two expressions
Less(x,y): smaller one of two expressions
Ref(x,t): the input expression at t days before
Mean(x,t): mean in the past t days
Sum(x,t): total sum in the past t days
Std(x,t): standard deviation in the past t days
Var(x,t): variance in the past t days
Max(x,t): maximum in the past t days
Min(x,t): minimum in the past t days
Med(x,t): median in the past t days
Mad(x,t): mean Absolute Deviation in the past t days
Delta(x,t): difference of the expression between today and t days before
WMA(x,t): weighted moving average in the past t days
EMA(x,t): exponential moving average in the past t days
Cov(x,y,t): covariance between two time-series in the past t days
Corr(x,y,t): correlation of two time-series in the past t days

Some examples of formulaic alphas:
- Abs(Sub(EMA(open,30d),30.))
- Max(WMA(open,10d),20d)
- Cov(Ref(volume,10d),open,50d)
- Greater(0.1,volume)

## Limits

- You may not need to access any real-world stock data, since I will provide you with enough information to make a decision.
- You should give me alphas that are of medium length, not too long, nor too short.
- Do not use features or operators that are not listed above.

2025-02-23 17:55:51,361-DEBUG-[user] Please generate 20 alphas that you think would be indicative of future stock price trend. Each alpha should be on its own line without numbering. Please do not output anything else.

The user wants these alphas to indicate future stock price trends, each using mathematical expressions with the allowed operators and features.", '', 'First, I need to understand what each operator does. For example, EMA is an exponential moving average, which gives more weight to recent data. So maybe combining EMA with something else could predict trend changes.', '', 'I remember that in technical analysis, moving averages are often used alongside other indicators. Maybe I can create an alpha where the EMA of the opening price crosses above or below another EMA, indicating a potential trend change.', '', "Another idea is to use volatility measures like Var or Std. High volatility might indicate uncertainty, which could precede a trend reversal. So maybe using the variance over 10 days to see if it's increasing could be an indicator.", '', 'I also think about the Median and Minimum functions. If I take the median of high prices minus some EMA, it might show whether the market is trending strongly up or down based on past highs.', '', "The Delta operator compares today's value with a past one. For example, if the closing price delta over 5 days is positive, that could signal an upward trend.", '', 'I should also consider combining indicators with time series like WMA and EMA. Maybe using Covariance between volume and another indicator could show how trading volume relates to price movements, which might predict future trends.', '', "I need to make sure each alpha is unique and not repeating the same strategy. Let's think about different aspects: volatility, momentum, trend reversal, etc.", '', "So, I'll start by creating alphas that use EMA with different time spans to see if there's a divergence in prices or volumes. Then, include indicators like Std to assess volatility, which might signal increased risk of price movement.", '', 'I should also incorporate functions like Ref and Mean for past data analysis, which could help identify patterns over specific periods.', '', "Finally, I'll structure each alpha on its own line without any numbering, ensuring they are varied in approach but all within the allowed operators and features.", '</think>', '', '1.
