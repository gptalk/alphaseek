2025-02-23 18:08:22,492-DEBUG-[system] You are an expert quant researcher developing formulaic alphas.

# Specification

The formulaic alphas are expressed as mathematical expressions.
An expression can be a real constant between -30 and 30, an input feature, or an operator applied with its operands.
The input features available are: $open, $close, $high, $low, $volume, $vwap.
The operators, their descriptions, and their required operand types are listed in the table below. The operands x and y denote expressions, and t denotes a time span in days between "1d" and "50d".

Abs(x): absolute value
Log(x): logarithm
Add(x,y): add
Sub(x,y): subtract
Mul(x,y): multiply
Div(x,y): divide
Greater(x,y): larger one of two expressions
Less(x,y): smaller one of two expressions
Ref(x,t): the input expression at t days before
Mean(x,t): mean in the past t days
Sum(x,t): total sum in the past t days
Std(x,t): standard deviation in the past t days
Var(x,t): variance in the past t days
Max(x,t): maximum in the past t days
Min(x,t): minimum in the past t days
Med(x,t): median in the past t days
Mad(x,t): mean Absolute Deviation in the past t days
Delta(x,t): difference of the expression between today and t days before
WMA(x,t): weighted moving average in the past t days
EMA(x,t): exponential moving average in the past t days
Cov(x,y,t): covariance between two time-series in the past t days
Corr(x,y,t): correlation of two time-series in the past t days

Some examples of formulaic alphas:
- Abs(Sub(EMA(open,30d),30.))
- Max(WMA(open,10d),20d)
- Cov(Ref(volume,10d),open,50d)
- Greater(0.1,volume)

## Limits

- You may not need to access any real-world stock data, since I will provide you with enough information to make a decision.
- You should give me alphas that are of medium length, not too long, nor too short.
- Do not use features or operators that are not listed above.

2025-02-23 18:08:24,200-DEBUG-[user] Please generate 20 alphas that you think would be indicative of future stock price trend. Each alpha should be on its own line without numbering. Please do not output anything else.
2025-02-23 18:09:02,031-DEBUG-[assistant] ['<think>', "Okay, so I'm trying to come up with some formulaic alphas that can indicate a stock's future price trend. From the examples given, I see that they use various operators and functions like EMA, WMA, Max, Min, etc., applied to features such as open, close, high, low, volume, vwap.", '', 'First, I need to understand each operator and function so I can apply them correctly. For instance, EMA is an exponential moving average which gives more weight to recent data, making it responsive to price changes. WMA uses weights based on their recency but not exponentially as EMA does. Max and Min would help identify the highest or lowest values in a given time frame.', '', 'I should start by considering common indicators used in technical analysis like RSI (Relative Strength Index), Bollinger Bands, MACD, etc., because they can signal overbought/oversold conditions, volatility, momentum changes, which are all indicative of future price trends.', '', 'RSI is calculated using the formula: (EMA(uptrend) / EMA(downtrend)) * 100. Here, uptrend and downtrend are calculated based on the average gains and losses over a period. So I can create an RSI-like indicator using EMA for the given time frame.', '', "Bollinger Bands have a middle band as a simple moving average (SMA) of price data, and upper/lower bands at a set standard deviation away from that SMA. Since we don't have standard deviation directly, but we do have Var and Cov functions. However, Var is variance over t days, so the square root of Var would give the standard deviation.", '', "For MACD, it's calculated as the difference between the 26-period and 12-period EMAs, then smoothed with a 9-period EMA. So I can compute EMA(open, 12d) - EMA(open, 26d), then take EMA of that result over 9 days.", '', 'Momentum is simply the percentage change in price over a period, so (close_t / close_{t-n}) * 100 - 1. I can use the Delta function: ((Delta(close,t) * 100 + 1) ^ (1/t)) - 1 or something similar.', '', "The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is the difference between two EMAs, so that's straightforward.", '', "Average True Range (ATR) measures volatility by calculating the average of the true range over a period. The true range is the maximum of high-low, high-open previous, low-open previous. Since we don't have ATR directly, but we can use Sum and Max functions: sum over t days of max(high - low, abs(open - prevclose)) divided by t.", '', 'On Balance Volume (OBV) sums up volumes based on price movements. If close > open, add volume; else subtract it. So I need to compare current close with previous close each day within the time frame and accumulate accordingly.', '', 'The Relative Strength Index (RSI) can be calculated as mentioned earlier using EMA of gains over EMA of losses.', '', 'Bollinger Bands involve calculating the standard deviation, which we can approximate using square root of variance. Then add/subtract that from the SMA to create bands.', '', "Chande Momentum Oscillator compares today's price change with the previous periodâ€™s high minus low. So it's (close_t - close_{t-1}) / (high_{t-1} - low_{t-1}) * 100, then multiply by 2 and subtract from 100.", '', 'Chande Index is a momentum oscillator that measures the percentage price change over n periods relative to the range of high-low during those same periods. So for each day in t days, calculate (close - open) / (high - low) * 100, sum them up and divide by t, then multiply by 5.', '', "Vortex Indicator uses the direction of movement based on high, low, and close to determine trend strength. It's a vector function combining these three elements over n periods.", '', 'The Accumulation/Distribution Index measures volume weighted price movements, so if close > open, add volume; else subtract it, scaled appropriately.', '', 'I should also consider other indicators like the Aroon Oscillator for uptrend/downtrend signals based on the time spent above and below certain thresholds. Also, the Chikou Span is a lagging indicator that connects current price to past price, used in things likeclouds in TDA.', '', 'However, I need to make sure each alpha is within medium length, so not too long or convoluted. Let me try structuring these ideas into 20 alphas:', '', '1. RSI using EMA of gains over losses.', '2. Bollinger Bands upper and lower with SMA as the middle line.', '3.
