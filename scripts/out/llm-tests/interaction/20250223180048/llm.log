2025-02-23 18:00:52,026-DEBUG-[system] You are an expert quant researcher developing formulaic alphas.

# Specification

The formulaic alphas are expressed as mathematical expressions.
An expression can be a real constant between -30 and 30, an input feature, or an operator applied with its operands.
The input features available are: $open, $close, $high, $low, $volume, $vwap.
The operators, their descriptions, and their required operand types are listed in the table below. The operands x and y denote expressions, and t denotes a time span in days between "1d" and "50d".

Abs(x): absolute value
Log(x): logarithm
Add(x,y): add
Sub(x,y): subtract
Mul(x,y): multiply
Div(x,y): divide
Greater(x,y): larger one of two expressions
Less(x,y): smaller one of two expressions
Ref(x,t): the input expression at t days before
Mean(x,t): mean in the past t days
Sum(x,t): total sum in the past t days
Std(x,t): standard deviation in the past t days
Var(x,t): variance in the past t days
Max(x,t): maximum in the past t days
Min(x,t): minimum in the past t days
Med(x,t): median in the past t days
Mad(x,t): mean Absolute Deviation in the past t days
Delta(x,t): difference of the expression between today and t days before
WMA(x,t): weighted moving average in the past t days
EMA(x,t): exponential moving average in the past t days
Cov(x,y,t): covariance between two time-series in the past t days
Corr(x,y,t): correlation of two time-series in the past t days

Some examples of formulaic alphas:
- Abs(Sub(EMA(open,30d),30.))
- Max(WMA(open,10d),20d)
- Cov(Ref(volume,10d),open,50d)
- Greater(0.1,volume)

## Limits

- You may not need to access any real-world stock data, since I will provide you with enough information to make a decision.
- You should give me alphas that are of medium length, not too long, nor too short.
- Do not use features or operators that are not listed above.

2025-02-23 18:00:52,675-DEBUG-[user] Please generate 20 alphas that you think would be indicative of future stock price trend. Each alpha should be on its own line without numbering. Please do not output anything else.

The goal is to create alphas that indicate a future stock price trend. Let me start by understanding what each operator and feature does.', '', "First, I'll list out the features: open, close, high, low, volume, vwap. These are all standard financial indicators. Now, looking at the operators, they include basic math operations like add, subtract, multiply, divide, as well as more complex functions like Abs, Log, Mean, etc.", '', "I need to think about what each alpha should capture. For example, trends can be identified by comparing today's price with past averages or moving averages. Volatility is another aspect that could indicate future price movements. Momentum indicators like EMA and WMA might show if a stock is gaining or losing speed.", '', "Let me consider each operator and how it can be applied to the features. For instance, using Mean(open, t) to check if today's open is above average in the past t days suggests an upward trend. Similarly, comparing Volume with its moving average could indicate volume strength.", '', 'I should also think about combining multiple features. For example, Med(high, low, t) might smooth out extreme values and give a central tendency that could signal trend changes.', '', "It's important to ensure each alpha is unique and covers different aspects of stock behavior without duplicating too much with others. Also, they shouldn't be too long or too short in terms of complexity based on the user's limits.", '', 'Let me start drafting alphas:', '', "1.
